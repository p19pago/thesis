## Progress

**Tuesday, October 24th, 2023:** Introduction to thesis. Download and use two (2) datasets

For the first check-point of my thesis experiment, an introduction was made on Decision Support Systems. 
Two (2) datasets, for the model, were downloaded and used.

  * one, from the [Kaggle official website](https://kaggle.com)
  * one, obtained externally.

**Wednesday, November 1st, 2023:** Further work on the model and implement its logic.

Having worked on the first steps of the model, the next task is implement the logic of the model.
In brief, find how many columns are used on each dataset *[on both their CSV and XLS format(s)]* , in order for us to assign classification for each column on both datasets.
