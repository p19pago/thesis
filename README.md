## thesis-dss

A repository where I will share my progress out of my experiment, as part of my thesis for the academic year of 2023-2024.

## About

The topic I have chosen for my thesis, is develop a **Decision Support System (DSS)** and **mobile application** on Breast Cancer diagnoses.

## Progress

**Tuesday, October 24th, 2023:** Introduction to thesis. Download and use two (2) datasets

### This is the first checkpoint.

For the first check-point of my thesis experiment, an introduction was made on Decision Support Systems. 

Two (2) datasets, for the model, were downloaded and used.

  * one, from the [Kaggle official website](https://kaggle.com)
  * one, obtained externally.

**Wednesday, November 1st, 2023:** Further work on the model and implement its logic.

### This is the second checkpoint.

Having worked on the first steps of the model, the next task is implement the logic of the model.
<br>
In brief, find how many columns are used on each dataset *[on both their CSV and XLS format(s)]* .

Then, assign which classification method will be applied, for each column of both datasets.
<br>
*(or on each dataset, depending on its effectiveness)*

Describing and taking notes on each dataset's contents, I realized each dataset, ought to be analyzed, one by one.

**Sunday, November 12th, 2023:** Select which datasets should be split into training and testing sets.
<br>
Assign train and test set(s) each.
